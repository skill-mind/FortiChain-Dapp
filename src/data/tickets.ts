      description: 'Issue with MetaConnect Wallet - Transaction Stuck',
      message: `Hello Support Team,
  
  I tried sending ETH from my MetaConnect Wallet to another address, but the transaction has been stuck as "pending" for over an hour. I used the recommended gas fees, but it still hasn’t gone through. My wallet address is 0x1234abcd5678efgh9012jklmnopqrstuvwx, and the transaction hash is 0xa1b2c3d4e5f67890123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef.
  
  I’ve tried refreshing and reconnecting my wallet, but the issue persists. Can you help me resolve this?`,
